This mod enhances the behavior of the **Crafter Block** in Minecraft by adding smarter and more consistent logic. Its purpose is simple: prevent the crafter from performing a craft when it doesn’t have a proper template or valid item setup—eliminating accidental or unwanted crafting.

### How This Mod Works
- The crafter only activates when it has a **template** and the **correct number of items**.
- If the conditions aren’t met, the mod automatically **cancels updates** and **blocks crafting**.
  
> In short: safer, more reliable, and much more logical for any automation setup.
